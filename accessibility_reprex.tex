\section{Introduction}\label{sec-intro}

The earliest catches of Petrale sole are reported in 1876 in California
and 1884 in Oregon. Petrale sole were lightly exploited during the early
1900s, but new gear technology in the 1930s allowed trawling on new
grounds and the fishery expanded to greater depths and to Oregon and
Washington waters, resulting in larger landings. The Petrale sole
catches further increased during World War II in response to increased
demands. Also, during the ``vitamin A rush'' in the late 1930s and 1940s
it was found that Petrale sole has high levels, which contributed to
increased catches of this species as well. By the 1950s, the fishery was
well developed with the stock showing declines in biomass and catches
(Figures i and ii). Also in the 1950s, winter spawning grounds at deeper
depths with dense concentrations of Petrale sole were discovered, and
catches increased accordingly. The rate of decline in spawning biomass
accelerated through the 1970s reaching minimums estimated to be
generally around or below 10\% of the unexploited levels during the
1980s through the early 2000s (Figure iii). Recent annual catches
between 1981--2022 range between 803 and 3060 mt per year and the most
recent landings are shown in Table i. Petrale sole are a desirable
market species and discarding has historically been low (less than
5.1\%), with most of the discarding due to small sizes.

There is little information regarding the stock structure of Petrale
sole off the U.S. West Coast. No genetic research has been undertaken
for Petrale sole and there is no other published research indicating
separate stocks of Petrale sole within U.S. waters. Tagging studies show
adult Petrale sole can move as much as 500 km, having the ability to be
highly migratory with the possibility for homing ability (Alverson and
Chatwin 1957). Juveniles show little coastwide or bathymetric movement
while studies suggest that adults generally move inshore and northward
onto the continental shelf during the spring and summer to feeding
grounds and offshore and southward during the fall and winter to deep
water spawning grounds (Horton 1989; Love 1996). Adult Petrale sole can
tolerate a wide range of bottom temperatures (Perry, Stocker, and Fargo
1994).

The NWFSC has updated the assessment for Petrale sole along the U.S.
West Coast to help identify any concerns for management and aid in
management decisions.

\section{Data}\label{sec-data}

Data comprise the foundational components of stock assessment models.
The decision to include or exclude particular data sources in an
assessment model depends on many factors. These factors often include,
but are not limited to, the way in which data were collected (e.g.,
measurement method and consistency); the spatial and temporal coverage
of the data; the quantity of data available per desired sampling unit;
the representativeness of the data to inform the modeled processes of
importance; timing of when the data were provided; limitations imposed
by the Terms of Reference; and the presence of an avenue for the
inclusion of the data in the assessment model. Attributes associated
with a data source can change through time, as can the applicability of
the data source when different modeling approaches are explored (e.g.,
stock structure or time-varying processes). Therefore, the specific data
sources included or excluded from this assessment should not necessarily
constrain the selection of data sources applicable to future stock
assessments for Petrale sole. Even if a data source is not directly used
in the stock assessment they can provide valuable insights into biology,
fishery behavior, or localized dynamics.Data comprise the foundational

source is not directly used in the stock assessment they can provide
valuable insights into biology, fishery behavior, or localized dynamics.

Since 2011, trawl fisheries have been managed with catch shares under a
system of annual individual fishing quotas (IFQs) for the shoreside
sector (i.e., vessels delivering to shoreside processors) and harvest
cooperatives for the at-sea hake sectors (catcher-processors who catch
and process hake at sea; and Motherships, factory processors that take
delivery of hake from catcher vessels at sea). Constant monitoring of
catch using observers or electronic monitoring (EM) is required to
participate in the trawl catch share fishery.

\section{Results}\label{sec-results}

The model fits the (s-wcgbt) index very well, including a decline from
2005 to 2009 followed by a rapid increase to a plateau in 2013--2017 and
a gradual decline to the most recent observations (fig-spawn\_bio). The
observations that fit the least well are 2018 and 2019, which were lower
than the years before and after. The absence of a 2020 survey due to the
COVID-19 pandemic makes it difficult to determine if those two years
were just outliers or if there was some unexplained population dynamics
leading to a reduction in available biomass for those years.

When an extra standard deviation parameter was estimated for the
(s-wcgbt), the value was minimal, indicating that the index fits well
enough to not require additional tuning. These findings can have major
implications to management (See Section~\ref{sec-discussion}).

The terminal year (2023) spawning biomass reference point was valued at
0.288243 when fishing was occurring at 0.179929. This changed
drastically over the period of 178 years (management and monitoring
beginning in 1845).
