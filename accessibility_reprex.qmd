## Introduction {#sec-intro}

The earliest catches of `r params$species` are reported in 1876 in California and 1884 in Oregon. `r params$species` were lightly exploited during the early 1900s, but new gear technology in the 1930s allowed trawling on new grounds and the fishery expanded to greater depths and to Oregon and Washington waters, resulting in larger landings. The `r params$species` catches further increased during World War II in response to increased demands. Also, during the “vitamin A rush” in the late 1930s and 1940s it was found that `r params$species` has high levels, which contributed to increased catches of this species as well. By the 1950s, the fishery was well developed with the stock showing declines in biomass and catches (Figures i and ii). Also in the 1950s, winter spawning grounds at deeper depths with dense concentrations of `r params$species` were discovered, and catches increased accordingly. The rate of decline in spawning biomass accelerated through the 1970s reaching minimums estimated to be generally around or below 10% of the unexploited levels during the 1980s through the early 2000s (Figure iii). Recent annual catches between 1981–2022 range between 803 and 3060 mt per year and the most recent landings are shown in Table i. `r params$species` are a desirable market species and discarding has historically been low (less than 5.1%), with most of the discarding due to small sizes.

There is little information regarding the stock structure of `r params$species` off the U.S. West Coast. No genetic research has been undertaken for `r params$species` and there is no other published research indicating separate stocks of `r params$species` within U.S. waters. Tagging studies show adult `r params$species` can move as much as 500 km, having the ability to be highly migratory with the possibility for homing ability [@alverson_results_1957]. Juveniles show little coastwide or bathymetric movement while studies suggest that adults generally move inshore and northward onto the continental shelf during the spring and summer to feeding grounds and offshore and southward during the fall and winter to deep water spawning grounds [@horton_species_1989; @love_milton_probably_1996]. Adult `r params$species` can tolerate a wide range of bottom temperatures [@perry_environmental_1994].

The `r params$office` has updated the assessment for `r params$species` along the U.S. West Coast to help identify any concerns for management and aid in management decisions. 

## Data {#sec-data}

Data comprise the foundational components of stock assessment models.
The decision to include or exclude particular data sources in an assessment model depends on many factors.
These factors often include, but are not limited to,
the way in which data were collected (e.g., measurement method and consistency);
the spatial and temporal coverage of the data;
the quantity of data available per desired sampling unit;
the representativeness of the data to inform the modeled processes of importance;
timing of when the data were provided;
limitations imposed by the Terms of Reference; and
the presence of an avenue for the inclusion of the data in the assessment model. 
Attributes associated with a data source can change through time,
as can the applicability of the data source when different modeling approaches are explored (e.g., stock structure or time-varying processes).
Therefore, the specific data sources included or excluded from this assessment should not necessarily constrain the selection of data sources applicable to future stock assessments for `r params$species`.
Even if a data source is not directly used in the stock assessment they can provide valuable insights into biology, fishery behavior, or localized dynamics.Data comprise the foundational components of stock assessment models.

Since 2011, trawl fisheries have been managed with catch shares under a system of annual individual fishing quotas (IFQs) for the shoreside sector (i.e., vessels delivering to shoreside processors) and harvest cooperatives for the at-sea hake sectors (catcher-processors who catch and process hake at sea; and Motherships, factory processors that take delivery of hake from catcher vessels at sea). Constant monitoring of catch using observers or electronic monitoring (EM) is required to participate in the trawl catch share fishery.

## Results {#sec-results}

The model fits the (s-wcgbt) index very well, including a decline from 2005 to 2009 followed by a rapid increase to a plateau in 2013--2017 and a gradual decline to the most recent observations (fig-spawn_bio). The observations that fit the least well are 2018 and 2019, which were lower than the years before and after. The absence of a 2020 survey due to the COVID-19 pandemic makes it difficult to determine if those two years were just outliers or if there was some unexplained population dynamics leading to a reduction in available biomass for those years.

When an extra standard deviation parameter was estimated for the (s-wcgbt), the value was minimal, indicating that the index fits well enough to not require additional tuning. These findings can have major implications to management (See @sec-discussion).

The terminal year (`r end_yr`) spawning biomass reference point was valued at `r sb_ref` when fishing was occurring at `r f_ref`. This changed drastically over the period of `r end_yr - str_yr` years (management and monitoring beginning in `r str_yr`).
